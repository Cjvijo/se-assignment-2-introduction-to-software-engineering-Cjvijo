# Q3. Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

# A. Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
# 1. Planning:
This is the initial phase where the project's objectives, scope, purpose, and feasibility are determined. It involves stakeholder meetings, feasibility studies, and resource planning to outline the project timeline, budget, and required resources.

# 2. Requirements Analysis:
In this phase, detailed requirements of the software system are gathered from stakeholders. It involves creating requirement specifications that include functional and non-functional requirements. This documentation serves as the foundation for the design and development phases.

# 3. Design:
The design phase translates requirements into architectural and detailed design specifications. This includes defining the system architecture, data models, interface designs, and algorithms. Design documents and diagrams are created to guide developers.

# 4. Implementation (Coding):
During the implementation phase, the actual code for the software is written based on the design specifications. This phase involves writing, compiling, and debugging code using various programming languages and tools. Code is developed in modules or components which are then integrated.

# 5. Testing:
The testing phase involves verifying that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. It includes different levels of testing such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Bugs and issues are identified and fixed.

# 6. Deployment:
In the deployment phase, the software is released to the production environment where end-users can use it. This phase may involve setting up the production environment, installing the software, migrating data, and conducting final testing. User training and documentation may also be provided.

# 7. Maintenance:
After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase where it is monitored and maintained to ensure it continues to function as required. This phase includes fixing any issues that arise, making improvements, and updating the software to meet new requirements or environments.

# B. Agile vs. Waterfall Models
# Agile Model:

# 1. Iterative and Incremental:
Agile development is iterative and incremental, delivering small, usable segments of the software in regular intervals (sprints). This allows for continuous feedback and improvement.

# 2. Flexibility:
Agile is highly flexible and adaptive to changes. Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.

# 3. Customer Collaboration:
Agile emphasizes customer collaboration and feedback. Customers are involved throughout the development process, ensuring the final product meets their needs.

# 4. Rapid Delivery:
